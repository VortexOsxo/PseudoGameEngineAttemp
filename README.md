## Hello

This project is mostly a draft, and my main objective while working on it was to try and properly use design patterns as I was learning them. I also just tried to implement and add any idea that passed through my head. This is why this project may be a little messy and unfinished, as I never had any end goal in mind.

I am also aware that there are still a lot of things to be fixed in this code. However, as they are the least interesting tasks, I will indefinitely procrastinate on them. If you are a recruiter, please don't judge me too harshly :)
