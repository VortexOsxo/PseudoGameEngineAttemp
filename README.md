## Hello
This project is mostly a draft, my main objective while working on it was to tried and use properly the design pattern as I was learning them. 
I also just tried to implement and add any idea that passed trhough my head, this is why this project may be a little messy and unfinished as I never had any end goal in mind.
I also know that there is still a lot of thing to be fizxed in this code, but as they are the least interesting task I will undefinitely procrastinate on them.
If you are a recruiter please dont judge me to harshly :)
